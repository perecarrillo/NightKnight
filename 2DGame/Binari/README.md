## Requirements
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 (install the `vc_redist.x86.exe` if you don't already have it)

Just launch the `NightKnight.exe` executable

## Note
Do not move the executable or any other .dll's or folders to a different location, it will break the application. You can create a direct access and move it elsewhere.
